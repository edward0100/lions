        <h1>Facts About Lions</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides.</li>
            <li>A group of lions usually includes related females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males.</li>
            <li>Lions are carnivorous and primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo.</li>
            <li>Male lions are easily recognized by their manes, which can range from blonde to black in color.</li>
            <li>Lions can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour for short distances.</li>
            <li>Despite their fearsome reputation, lions spend much of their time resting and can sleep for up to 20 hours a day.</li>
            <li>The lion population has declined by more than 40% over the past two decades due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.</li>
